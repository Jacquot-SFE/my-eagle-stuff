# Eagle Files

*By Byron Jacquot, SparkFun Electronics*

Some Eagle PCB files that I want to be portable for the PCB design talk I'm going to give, as well as an area to save & share my scratch work.

This stuff doesn't really standalone.  Some of the other resources I'm bringing in:

* The [SparkFun Eagle PCB Tutorial](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/115).  I work here, and there are time that I google for Eagle information, and this is *still* the first link that comes up!
* [SparkFun's Eagle Components Libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries)
* [SparkFun's Eagle Settings Repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Eagle_Settings)
* The sample I've been using for the layout is Eric Archer's Mini Space Rocker.  He's published several items for it.
 * [The Schematic](http://www.ericarcher.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mini-space-rockers.pdf)
 * [Some capacitor recipes](http://www.ericarcher.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mini-space-rockers-flavas.pdf)
 * [Instructions](http://www.ericarcher.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mini-space-rockers-instructions.pdf)
 * [Mouser BOM](http://www.ericarcher.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mini-space-rockers-parts-mouser.pdf)


A [good breakdown](http://www.blackstick.co.uk/pcb-design-fabrication-tutorial.php) of the PCB manufacturing process.
